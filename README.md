another very small project. javascript was easier to grasp in this one. still 100% did not write it well but it works so im not touching it. Going to go for a big website
landing page project for the next challenge to spend some time on it and have a fully operational webpage. challenge was fun and also had fun thinking of 
the solution. Ended up opting for two div wrappers second one absolute positioning and adding a class to display one once submit is clicked, 

Thank you!
